<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![lessonbook-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82396393/134024872-161e9557-9c64-4506-8592-679519c24d1b.png)

The idea for this app came to me while teaching lessons to my students at the University of Northern Colorado. I always keep a notebook to track my students' progress in lessons including their assignments, grades, and repertoire and I thought that having a way to manage my studio digitally would be incredibly useful. Lessonbook is a digital tool do just that, and it can be used by both teachers and students!

Features of Lessonbook:
* For teachers, having a single space dedicated to tracking your students lessons is incredibly time saving! 
* For students, you can keep a practice log to make sure you are working on the materials each day for your next lesson! 
* Students and Teachers can both leave comments on an individual lesson to ask questions, clarify an assignment, or leave an encouraging note! 

### Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
